Welcome to my airport challenge!

IRB testing:
To start the program, please go into the lib folder via the command line and enter into IRB on the plane.rb file (irb -r ./plane.rb). From here, the instructions should be able to guide you through.

RSPEC testing: You should be able to see these results by typing rspec inside the airport_challenge folder.

I hope you enjoy!
